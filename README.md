# copy 730

Copy your `730` folder from your own userdata folder into every other userdata folder.

## Usage

Download the python script ([`copy_730.py`](copy_730.py)) and edit your own userdata folder on [line 4](copy_730.py#L4).

Then execute it and let the script handle the rest. It'll take the 730 folder and copy it into every other folder, overwriting everything if it already existed.
